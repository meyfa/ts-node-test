/**
 * Resolve a given set of (user-provided) input paths to explicit file names.
 *
 * Paths referring to singular files will be returned as-is, while paths referring to directories will be recursed into
 * and the list of all deeply nested files will be returned.
 *
 * The resulting list will be filtered to only contain supported file extensions.
 *
 * @param paths The input paths.
 * @param extensions The supported file extensions.
 * @param readDirectory A function which can return the names of the files and folders in a directory (excluding '.' and '..')
 * @returns An array containing all (matching and non-directory) file names explicitly.
